# Sensor Battle

Final project for Physical Computing course @ NYU ITP\
by George, Jason, Minyoung, Rui, Sara

In the spirit of COVID-19 remote learning, we wanted to create synchronous entertainment done remotely – the first ITP Sensor Battle. We are a group of 5 members located in 13-hour-difference time zones and we created a live sensor battle entertainment connected via the internet. This is a match among 3 players to determine the best and strongest sensor. 3 players, in the USA, are battling with 3 different sensors – joystick, gesture and muscle sensors – connected to the 'battle server' to control their respective RC cars in Beijing battle ground. The battle ground and competing RC cars are in Beijing and players and their sensors are in the USA.
